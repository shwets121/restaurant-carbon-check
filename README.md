## Long Description

“While it may seem small, the ripple effects of small things is extraordinary.”
With that extra cutlery you add to your food order or the ketchup sachet pushed in, with that exquisite mozerella you procured straight from Italy, it might not just widen the hole in your pocket but to our atmosphere too.
Have you heard of a fruit called makhanphal that grows in Karnataka, which can very well replace the avocado that you procured from America. Transportation has a significant impact within the food and beverage sector because food is often shipped long distances and not infrequently via air. 
Similarly, the mozerella that you love goes through various stages of a food life cycle – from farm growing -> animal feed ->processing -> transport->retail -> packaging. Each stage results in some carbon emission, where we have an opportunity to optimize and reduce the emission. 
How do food production contribute to climate change
The quantity of greenhouse gases (GHGs) generated by our food can vary considerably across the global food supply chain. Increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide are responsible for about two-thirds of the total energy imbalance that is causing Earth's temperature to rise.
Removal of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) combined with emission reduction is necessary to keep climate warming below the internationally agreed target. There are various approaches being followed and researched for the various food cycle stages like improved land management, using plant based alternatives.
It has been researched that food production is responsible for one-quarter of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. In the visualization below we see GHG emissions from 29 different food products – from beef at the top to nuts at the bottom.

For each product you can see from which stage in the supply chain its emissions originate. This extends from land use changes on the left, through to transport and packaging on the right.
This is data from the largest meta-analysis of global food systems to date, published in Science by Joseph Poore and Thomas Nemecek (2018).

The most important insight from this study: there are massive differences in the GHG emissions of different foods: producing a kilogram of beef emits 60 kilograms of greenhouse gases (CO2-equivalents). While peas emits just 1 kilogram per kg.
Transport is a small contributor to emissions as well. For most food products, it accounts for less than 10%. Not just transport, but all processes in the supply chain after the food left the farm – processing, transport, retail and packaging – mostly account for a small share of emissions.
Every small reduction in these emissions will, in the long run, count big toward the effort in dealing with climate change. 
About the application
CaterGreen is an application not serving green food but the serving food in a way that helps sustain the green on our planet and so reduce vulnerability to climate impacts. 
It helps a restaurant owner monitor, estimate and reduce the carbon emissions per order intake via recommending  – 
1.	Substitute ingredients that has low carbon emission
2.	Providing information to procure food locally 
3.	Use environment friendly packaging.

## Solution

The application utilizes angular to present a dashboard view visualization of weekly/monthly/daily trends of carbon footprint from the food orders based on ingredients used, transportation mode associated with each ingredient and packaging that went to deliver that order as a take-away.
It uses NLP to compute of a recipe’s sustainability data, i.e. its carbon footprint, includes taking into account the combination and volumes of different ingredients. Each ingredient can also have its own carbon footprint value based on the transportation mode used to procure the same and due to the packaging material used along.

## Future Roadmap
Using the carbon data from multiple restaurants, analyze the trends, predict the footprint for a given geographical area. Neural network-plus-clustering techniques can be applied to model the data from a network of restaurants. It can further be made intuitive by enhancing the recommendation module to suggest nearer origin by scanning based on the current location of the restaurant.
